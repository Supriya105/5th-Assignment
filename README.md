#Loading of multiple tabs from multiple excel sheets into sql server,auditing and validationg.
Loaded multiple sheets from multiple excel files. 
Audited the results and validated the results. 
In Auditing step i have used ROW COUNT to check the rowcounts of a table against the staging tables. 
In validating, i have validated the sum of national counts of an excel sheet against the sum which i have calculated using AGGREGATE function. 
I have also uploaded the sql file showing the creation of State,county and zip tables.
